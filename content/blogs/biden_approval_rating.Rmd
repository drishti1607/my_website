Average net approval rate (approve - disapprove) for each week since Biden got into office, along with its 95%
confidence interval

> As we can see from the above graph, Biden's net approval ratings seem to follow similar trends amongst all three groups (Voters, Adults, All Polls). As we can observe, there is a huge dip after week 22, which reverts back to normal towards the end of the year. This can reflect the public attitude towards tight economic conditions, demonstrated for example by the surge in gas prices and inflation.
