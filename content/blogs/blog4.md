## Hello!
I'm **Drishti Hoskote**. I'm from *Bangalore, India* and I absolutely love travelling and photography. I'm a South-Indian movie junkie and I dance when I'm free.   
I just finished my undergrad in Computer Science Engineering and I'm leaning towards Product Management post LBS (although I am still exploring). I also really enjoy problem solving (sort of a love-hate relationship for me), and not just business related problems, I enjoy doing math problems too!

I have 3 goals in life (for now):   
1. To be financially well to do and independent   
2. Give back to society - I'd like to go back to India someday and make a difference in people's lives   
3. Have a healthy family and tight knit friend circle
