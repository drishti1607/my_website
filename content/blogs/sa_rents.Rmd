## Rentals evolution in San Francisco

```{r sf_median_prices}

    filter(city == "san francisco", beds <= 3) %>%
    group_by(beds, year) %>%

## Rentals Evolution in the top 12 cities

#top_twelve_cities

#Finding median price of each year in the top 12 cities

  group_by(year, city) %>%

## Conclusion

> There has been a overall increase in rental prices in the Bay Area between 2000 and 2018. This reflects the tech boom in the Bay Area. In particular, Palo Alto, the birthplace of Sillicon Valley, has experienced the highest rental increase. On the other hand, cities like Santa Rosa and San Jose, have experienced relatively lower rental increase. This increase can probably be accounted for by simple inflation adjustments. Most cities experienced a dip in prices around 2008-2010. We believe this reflects the housing bubble burst of 2008, which triggered a global financial crisis. Before this graphs can be seen to be increasing to a local peak when cheap credit and tax lending standards fueled the housing bubble. After 2010, the government bailouts helped the market recover and restart the economy, giving us an increasing trend in housing prices.
