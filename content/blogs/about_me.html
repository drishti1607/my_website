<div id="hello" class="section level2">
<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>I’m <strong>Drishti Hoskote</strong>. I’m from <em>Bangalore, India</em>. I’m a South-Indian movie junkie and I dance when I’m free. I just finished my undergrad in Computer Science Engineering and I’m leaning towards Product Management post LBS (although I am still exploring).</p>
<p>Back in 12th grade, I had to solve really tough calculus problems, ones that wouldn’t let me sleep when I couldn’t solve them. For some vague reason, these math problems ignited sparks in me. I knew that I needed to feel the same spark in whatever I chose as a career. And there it was again, at an entrepreneurship course which introduced me to business and problem-solving. I haven’t been able to get enough since.</p>
<p>I love ideating, executing those ideas, and watching them come to life. I love being creative and finding ways to connect with the customer. I started a side hustle, Athena, in my second year of undergrad to try and bridge the gap between school, extra tuition, and students. We work towards providing personalised and conceptual tutelage to school children by extrapolating the bond between college students and school children. Athena helped me build my foundations in business and let me explore the field further. I learnt how to communicate effectively, connect with the customer, build trust, market the service, and have tough conversations.</p>
<p>Other than that, I absolutely love travelling, photography, and dogs!</p>
